mpdas is a MPD AudioScrobbler client
supporting the 2.0 protocol specs.

It is written in C++ and uses libmpdclient
to retrieve the song data from MPD and
libcurl to post it to Last.fm

================================================

NOTE: There is a manpage available as well:
man mpdas

To configure mpdas, simply create a file called
.mpdasrc in your home directory or in
$PREFIX/mpdasrc. To change $PREFIX, modify the
Makefile.

Syntax is easy. Example:

username = lastfmuser
password = password

NOTE: In the past the password had to be an MD5
hash. As of v0.4.3 this has changed due to
Last.fm deprecating the previous authentication
method. Please supply the password in plain-text
from now on.

Configuration options:

username:		Last.FM username
password:		Last.FM password (plain-text)
host:			MPD Host
mpdpassword:		MPD Password
port:			MPD Port
composerfolder:	Folder holding files that must
                submit composer tags instead of
                artist tags
runas:			Change the user mpdas runs as
debug:			Print debug information
service:        Will scrobble to Libre.fm if set
                to "librefm"

================================================

Features:
- Sets now-playing status
- Scrobbling (obviously)
- Caching
- Config files
- User switching
- "Love" tracks on Last.fm
    (e.g. with 'mpc sendmessage mpdas love' and
     'mpc sendmessage mpdas unlove' to revert)

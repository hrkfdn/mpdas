================================================

mpdas is a MPD AudioScrobbler client
supporting the 2.0 protocol specs.

It is written in C++ and uses libmpdclient
to retrieve the song data from MPD and
libcurl to post it to Last.fm

================================================

NOTE: There is a manpage available as well:
man mpdas

To configure mpdas, simply create a file called 
.mpdasrc in your home directory or in
$PREFIX/mpdasrc. To change $PREFIX, modify the
Makefile.

Syntax is easy. Example:

username = lastfmuser
password = 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

Whereas password is your Last.FM password hashed
with MD5.

Configuration options:

username:		Last.FM username
password:		Last.FM password (MD5 hashed)
host:			MPD Host
mpdpassword:		MPD Password
port:			MPD Port
runas:			Change the user mpdas runs as
debug:			Print debug information

================================================

Features:
- Sets now-playing status
- Scrobbling (obviously)
- Caching
- Config files
- User switching
- "Love" tracks on Last.fm
    (e.g. with 'mpc sendmessage mpdas love')
- Optional UPnP support (see next)
================================================

If mpdas is configured with --enable-upnp, it supports monitoring an
UPnP renderer (as an alternative to monitoring mpd).

The build will need libupnpp:
http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/downloads.

The switch to UPnP use is triggered by the presence of the
upnpname variable inside the configuration file:

upnpname = upnp-friendly-name-or-uuid
